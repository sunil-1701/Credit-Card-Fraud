## Anomaly Detection
**Anomaly detection**, also known as **outlier detection**, is the process of identifying data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data. Anomalies can be caused by a variety of factors, such as fraud, errors, or unusual events.

## Dataset
Anomaly detection can be used to detect fraudulent in the Credit Card Fraud dataset as the dataset is highly imbalanced as only 0.17% of data belongs to fraudulent class.

## About project!
**Anomaly Detection** Algorithms such as:
* **Isolation Forest**
* **Local Outlier Factor**
are used against **Linear SVM**, to detect Credit Card fraud cases.

**Heatmap** is used to plot the correlation between features.
